## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:

I got rid of a couple lines of code where I picked the pen up and down for no reason. This helped it look cleaner. I also created better variable names, and made a better use of parameters.

Summary of function(s) added:

I first added a drawSecantCurve function. I created this by drawing a curve that is (1/cos). I then added a drawBigShape function where I ask the user for the number of sides, the size of each side, and the color they want their shape. After getting this information, the turtle draws the big shape and calculates its perimeter. I then added another function called drawLittleShape, which has constraints, so the shape has to be smaller than the big shape. It goes through the same process as the big shape function.  

Summary of Feature Added:

I ask the user for the number of sides of the shape, length of each side of the shape, and color that they want it. This is the case for both the big shape and little shape. I also calculated the perimeter of each, and at the end of the program, I divide the big shapes perimeter by the little shapes perimeter to figure out the factor of how much greater the perimeter of the big shape is compared to the little one.
